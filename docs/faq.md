```

Example test:
```javascript
const { TestClient } = require('@ourplatform/testing');

describe('Users API', () => {
  const client = new TestClient();
  
  it('should create a new user', async () => {
    const user = await client.users.create({
      name: 'Test User',
      email: 'test@example.com'
    });
    
    expect(user.id).toBeDefined();
    expect(user.name).toBe('Test User');
  });
});

### How do I set up CI/CD?

Example GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy
        env:
          API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
        run: npm run deploy
```

### What about environment variables in production?

Best practices:
- Use your hosting provider's environment variable system
